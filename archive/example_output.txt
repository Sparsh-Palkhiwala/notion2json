One of the best ways to build trust with employees is to be transparent in your communication. Transparent communication means making sure that all *legally releasable* information is available to employees in an **accurate and timely** manner. Transparent communication enhances the employees’ reasoning abilities and helps hold organizations accountable for their actions, policies, and practices. \n \n Sometimes it is not possible for a supervisor to answer certain questions, and part of the transparent communication is verbally letting the employee know that something is confidential or that you are not at liberty to talk about it. \n </li><li>**Learn more about what resources employees need to perform to the best of their abilities.** \n 1. One of the major reasons people experience burnout is because they don’t have the resources they need to effectively do their job.  By learning about and providing the resources employees need, supervisors can help employees feel connected to the organization and be effective in their work. This can look like the supervisor sitting down and having a conversation with the employee to discuss the resources needed for success at the job. Supervisors can do this on a schedule or an as-needed basis. \n 2. Common resources that employees need include:\n     1. Physical devices (such as laptops or desktops)\n     2. Time\n     3.

In these breaks, encourage employees to go into nature and take a walk instead of scrolling on their phones like we are all tempted to! \n 2.
