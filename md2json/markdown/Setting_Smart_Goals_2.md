#Setting Smart Goals 

## Introduction
Hi, I’m Kate and this is Psych for Life®.
It’s one thing to set a goal, and it’s another to set and complete it. How many times have we said we’ll do something [to get healthier] and then forgotten about it? Completing our goals gets difficult when we are too broad. We need to get specific about what we want and how we will get it.

That’s where SMART goals come into the mix. The framework of SMART goals can help improve our goal-setting skills in both our professional and personal lives.

In this video, we will cover:
- Why is knowing how to set goals important?
- What are SMART goals?

## Why is knowing how to set goals important?
Knowing how to effectively set goals is helpful in a practical sense because we are able to get tasks done. Even more importantly, effectively setting goals can help our well-being, helping us lower stress and increase our sense of control. 

Setting goals helps us:
- Focus on what’s important and avoid distractions.
- Put in more effort – whether it’s physical or mental. 
- Persist longer in tasks, even when faced with obstacles.
When we set goals, we need to focus on what we can control and be realistic with ourselves. This is where SMART goals come into play. SMART goals can help us in all aspects of our lives are straightforward to use. 

### What are SMART goals?
SMART stands for: 
- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

We will cover what exactly each component means in our next section. 

### Key Takeaways
Here are our key takeaways
- Setting effective goals can reduce our stress.
- Setting goals can help us focus on what is important and avoid distractions.
- SMART goals can help us break down our goals into manageable tasks.
Our next section will help you set a SMART goal using this framework and further explain what each component means. See you there! 

### Specific

[SPECIFIC]()

When we are setting our goals, we want to start by making sure they are specific. This means that our goal should be clear and well-defined. 

::activity::text_entry
<div>
label: Pick a goal you want to work on and make the goal.
variable: being_specific
placeholder: Instead I want to run more. I want to run 5 miles without stopping

label: How are you going to accomplish the goal?
variable: how_to_accomplish
placeholder: I will run everyday, and plan my rest
</div>

### Measurable

[MEASURABLE]()

Next, we want to make sure that we have a way to track our progress. Building on our previous example of improving job satisfaction, we can make this goal measurable by deciding how frequently we will write about what we enjoyed at work. 

::activity::text_entry
<div>
label: How will you measure your progress?
variable: being_measurable
placeholder: I will plan my runs, where I will reach one more mile each day
</div>

### Attainable

[ATTAINABLE]()

One important part of goal setting is to be realistic with ourselves. We need to make sure our goal is achievable.  We also don’t want our goal to be so easy that it has no real impact on our life. Research has shown that going for more challenging goals usually leads to better performance when we are committed and willing to learn new skills.

Choosing an attainable goal requires us to assess if we need additional people or resources, and to have a clear idea of our strengths and weaknesses. 

::activity::checkbox
<div>
label: Does this goal seem attainable to you?
variable: is_attainable
- Yes
- Definately Yes
- It is tough, but I will do it
</div>

::activity::text_entry
<div>
label: What skills do you have that can help you with this goal?
variable: skills_needed
placeholder: I am going to develop stamina to run 5 miles


label: What are some challenges in achieving this goal?
variable: expected_challenges
placeholder: Finding time to run everyday
</div>

::activity::checkbox
<div>
label: What is your plan for overcoming these challenges?
variable: how_to_overcome
Options: 
    - I will get help from someone (e.g. my boss, my parents, my friends)
    - I will learn a new skill.
    - I will identify the resources I need.
    - Other
</div>

::activity::text_entry
<div>
label: If this goal is too difficult to be attainable right now, how will you modify it?
variable: modification_if_needed
placeholder: Reducing the goal by 2 miles, and increasing timeline
</div>


### Relevant

[Relevant]()

The goal we set should matter to us and be relevant.  Our SMART goal of writing one thing every day that we enjoy at work is aligned with our long-term goal of improving our work satisfaction. This goal is relevant and useful in our lives. 

::activity::text_entry
<div>
label: How is this goal relevant to your life?
variable: life_relevance
placeholder: By running it is going to improve my fitness levels
 
label: How will achieving this goal help you?
variable: goal_relevance
placeholder: By running it is going to improve my fitness levels, which helps me to be more active with family
</div>


### Time-Bound

[Time-Bound]()

Finally, our goal needs a deadline. Having a deadline can help us stay on track.The time-bound aspect of SMART goals can be tricky because it will depend on our circumstances. 

We should set our deadline so it is consistent with all the other things we discussed. Our deadline should be specific and realistic. 

::activity::calendar_input
<div>
label : Chose when to complete your goal:
variable: smart_goals_Timeline
placeholder: MM/DD/YYYY
</div>

    
::activity::calender_input
<div>
label: When will you achieve your goal? 
variable: goal_expected_timeline
placeholder :  MM/DD/YYYY
</div>

### Conclusion

SMART goals are useful in all aspects of our lives. While our example focused specifically on work, we can use SMART goals in our personal lives for self-improvement, teaching our kids something, and so much more.

We can also use SMART goals to build a lot of the skills in Psych For Life modules, including healthy habits, getting adequate sleep, and practicing self-care.
