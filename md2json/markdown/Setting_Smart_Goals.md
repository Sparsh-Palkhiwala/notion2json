# Introduction

Hi, I’m Kate and this is Psych for Life®.

It’s one thing to set a goal, and it’s another to set and complete it. How many times have we said we’ll do something [to get healthier] and then forgotten about it? Completing our goals gets difficult when we are too broad. We need to get specific about what we want and how we will get it.

That’s where SMART goals come into the mix. The framework of SMART goals can help improve our goal-setting skills in both our professional and personal lives.

In this video, we will cover:

- Why is knowing how to set goals important?
- What are SMART goals?

## Why is knowing how to set goals important?

Knowing how to effectively set goals is helpful in a practical sense because we are able to get tasks done. Even more importantly, effectively setting goals can help our well-being, helping us lower stress and increase our sense of control. 

Setting goals helps us:

- Focus on what’s important and avoid distractions.
- Put in more effort – whether it’s physical or mental. 
- Persist longer in tasks, even when faced with obstacles.

When we set goals, we need to focus on what we can control and be realistic with ourselves. This is where SMART goals come into play. SMART goals can help us in all aspects of our lives are straightforward to use. 

### What are SMART goals?

SMART stands for: 

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

We will cover what exactly each component means in our next section. 

Here are our key takeaways:

Our next section will help you set a SMART goal using this framework and further explain what each component means. See you there! 

### Specific

VIDEO LINK:

When we are setting our goals, we want to start by making sure they are specific. This means that our goal should be clear and well-defined. 

::activity::text_entry
Label: Pick a goal you want to work on and make the goal.
Placeholder: Instead I want to run more. I want to run 5 miles without stopping
Variable: being_specific

::activity::text_entry
Label: How are you going to accomplish the goal?
Placeholder: I will run everyday, and plan my rest
Variable: how_to_accomplish


### Measurable

VIDEO LINK:

Next, we want to make sure that we have a way to track our progress. Building on our previous example of improving job satisfaction, we can make this goal measurable by deciding how frequently we will write about what we enjoyed at work. 

::activity::text_entry
Label: How will you measure your progress?
Placeholder: I will plan my runs, where I will reach one more mile each day
Variable: being_measurable


### Attainable

VIDEO LINK:

One important part of goal setting is to be realistic with ourselves. We need to make sure our goal is achievable.  We also don’t want our goal to be so easy that it has no real impact on our life. Research has shown that going for more challenging goals usually leads to better performance when we are committed and willing to learn new skills.

Choosing an attainable goal requires us to assess if we need additional people or resources, and to have a clear idea of our strengths and weaknesses. 

::activity::checkbox
Label: Does this goal seem attainable to you?
Placeholder: YES, I can do it !!
Variable: is_attainable

::activity::text_entry
Label: What skills do you have that can help you with this goal?
Placeholder: I am going to develop stamina to run 5 miles
Variable: skills_needed

::activity::text_entry
Label: What are some challenges in achieving this goal?
Placeholder: Finding time to run everyday
Variable: expected_challenges

::activity::checkbox
Label: What is your plan for overcoming these challenges?
Variable: how_to_overcome
Options: 
    - I will get help from someone (e.g. my boss, my parents, my friends)
    - I will learn a new skill.
    - I will identify the resources I need.
    - Other
    
::activity::text_entry
Label: If this goal is too difficult to be attainable right now, how will you modify it?
Placeholder: Reducing the goal by 2 miles, and increasing timeline
Variable: modification_if_needed


### Relevant

VIDEO LINK:

The goal we set should matter to us and be relevant.  Our SMART goal of writing one thing every day that we enjoy at work is aligned with our long-term goal of improving our work satisfaction. This goal is relevant and useful in our lives. 

::activity::text_entry
Label: How is this goal relevant to your life?
Placeholder: By running it is going to improve my fitness levels
Variable: life_relevance 

::activity::text_entry
Label: How will achieving this goal help you?
Placeholder: By running it is going to improve my fitness levels, which helps me to be more active with family
Variable: goal_relevance


### Time-Bound

VIDEO LINK:

Finally, our goal needs a deadline. Having a deadline can help us stay on track.The time-bound aspect of SMART goals can be tricky because it will depend on our circumstances. 

We should set our deadline so it is consistent with all the other things we discussed. Our deadline should be specific and realistic. 

::activity::calendar_input
Label : Chose when to complete your goal:
Placeholder: MM/DD/YYYY
Variable: smart_goals_Timeline

    
::activity::checkbox
Label: When will you achieve your goal? 
Placeholder :  MM/DD/YYYY
Variable: goal_expected_timeline


### Conclusion

SMART goals are useful in all aspects of our lives. While our example focused specifically on work, we can use SMART goals in our personal lives for self-improvement, teaching our kids something, and so much more.

We can also use SMART goals to build a lot of the skills in Psych For Life modules, including healthy habits, getting adequate sleep, and practicing self-care.
