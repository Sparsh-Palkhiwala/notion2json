# Romantic Relations Conflict 

## Introduction

[INTRODUCTION](https://vimeo.com/949636103/584a16dfd2)

Hi, I'm Kate, and this is Psych for Life. In this video, we're going to walk through managing conflict in romantic relationships. Conflicts are normal in every relationship, and working through them can actually strengthen your bond, but they can also be intimidating to talk about. Fortunately, we're here to help. We've listed out some effective tools and skills to manage conflicts with your partner.

The everyday tools section will help you whether or not you're currently experiencing conflict. These include:
- Schedule regular time to spend together
- Tell your partner what you love about them
- Practice acts of kindness towards your partner
- Schedule pleasant events to do together.

You’ll want to rely on the discussion skills section when you're having a tough conversation. These include, stay focused on the topic. Listen with the aim of understanding. Ask questions to understand their view. Try not to be defensive and work together to find solutions.

Consider going through any or all of these with your partner before starting a difficult conversation. And if things are going great, you can still use these to improve your relationship.


### Acts of Kindness

Okay, let's get started. First, write three things you love about your partner. These could include their sense of humor, the way they laugh, their thoughtfulness, and if they're particularly good at a skill - such as art or music. Next, write down a way that you can support your partner. Maybe it's listening, helping them plan something related to work or family, or even just making them a cup of coffee before a meeting. Finally, plan a pleasant event. You and your partner might wanna fill this out together.

### Romantic Reflection

You wanna go through the top section before starting the conversation [with your partner]. Take a minute to think both about the situation and how you're feeling about it. For instance, perhaps you're planning the calendar for the next few months and you're starting to feel anxious that you're getting overbooked. Next, consider what makes this situation difficult for you. In our example, maybe you're concerned about fulfilling your obligations.

### Active Listening

The bottom section on page three will help with active listening. When you're having a tough conversation, it can be natural to want to get a little defensive, but try to take the time to really understand where your partner is coming from. Remember, it's not you against them. It's you and them against the problem. Use these questions to try to understand your partner's point of view. 

- Tell me what it was like for you when this situation happened.
- Are there other feelings you have besides the first one you mentioned
- Could you help me understand what makes this situation difficult for you
- What can we work on together?
- Tell me more about what's wrong.
- How can I support you with this?

### Finding a solution together

Finally, on page four, you will work together to find a solution. First, describe what your partner was saying, the emotions they were feeling, and why it's important to them. In our example, working on the social calendar, you might recognize upon reflection that your partner was feeling disappointed that you weren't wanting to do the same things they wanted to do. It's important to your partner to connect with friends. 

Next, how do you feel after describing the conflict and what did you learn about your own perspective? You might recognize that you're more excited about some of these engagements than others, and you actually don't need to do everything together. Then, together, write out a solution to help you both reach your goals. Maybe you identify the solution that can help you both reach your goals is to prioritize what's most important to your partner and to perhaps determine what events you might skip to allow you to recover and get your work done. Finally, double check the solution makes you feel valued, appreciated, and connected. You feel comfortable that everything can be done, your partner is happy with the plan, and you're both looking forward to spending time together. If not, you may want to discuss other possible solutions as you go about implementing a solution. Be sure to break things down into small, actionable steps. Make sure to give both yourself and your partner credit for your hard work. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for your hard work.
