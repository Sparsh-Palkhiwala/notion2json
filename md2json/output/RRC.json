These could include their sense of humor, the way they laugh, their thoughtfulness, and if they're particularly good at a skill - such as art or music. Next, write down a way that you can support your partner. Maybe it's listening, helping them plan something related to work or family, or even just making them a cup of coffee before a meeting. Finally, plan a pleasant event. You and your partner might wanna fill this out together."

You might recognize that you're more excited about some of these engagements than others, and you actually don't need to do everything together. Then, together, write out a solution to help you both reach your goals. Maybe you identify the solution that can help you both reach your goals is to prioritize what's most important to your partner and to perhaps determine what events you might skip to allow you to recover and get your work done. Finally, double check the solution makes you feel valued, appreciated, and connected. You feel comfortable that everything can be done, your partner is happy with the plan, and you're both looking forward to spending time together. If not, you may want to discuss other possible solutions as you go about implementing a solution. Be sure to break things down into small, actionable steps. Make sure to give both yourself and your partner credit for your hard work. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for your hard work.
